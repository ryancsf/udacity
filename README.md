## Reflections
You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!

## What new skills have you learned?
I learned how to markup a document with the right semantics and structures.

## What has been easy?
The block of texts have already been separated nicely, so it's just a matter of putting in the right tags. That made the whole process easier.

## What has been difficult?
I had the dilemma whether to wrap the blocks of text in div or not. In the end, I decided not to as it will be quite redundant.

## How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
This project is quite straightforward, so there wasn't much thinking to be done. I did not face any difficulties yet but I foresee in the upcoming projects, I will need to think harder and the strategies will be useful.
